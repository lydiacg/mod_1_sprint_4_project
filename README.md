# Module 1 sprint 4 project

In the notebook, I will performing exploratory data analysis on the [Kaggle Coursera Course Dataset](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset). I am focusing on creating visualisation, as this is the focus of this sprint. 

I will be focusing on:
- the number of courses per organization
- the distrubtion of difficulty and certificate types
- the distribution of rating, and how this differs with difficulty and certificate type
- the distrubution of student enrollments numbers, and how this differs with difficulty and certificate type

I will also be doing some initial data cleaning, although the data quality is good so not much was required, and briefly discuss improvements for future analysis. 

The dataset is included in this repo.
